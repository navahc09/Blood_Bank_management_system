## üìã Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive Blood Bank Management System developed as part of our Database Management Systems coursework. The system provides an efficient, web-based platform for managing blood inventory, donor information, and blood requests from hospitals. It aims to streamline the process of blood donation and distribution, ensuring timely access to blood for those in need and providing a robust administrative interface for blood bank staff.
