## üìã Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive Blood Bank Management System developed as part of our Database Management Systems coursework. The system provides an efficient, web-based platform for managing blood inventory, donor information, and blood requests from hospitals. It aims to streamline the process of blood donation and distribution, ensuring timely access to blood for those in need and providing a robust administrative interface for blood bank staff.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration for both Admins and hospital staff.
* **Inventory Management:** Admins can add, update, and view the current stock of blood bags, categorized by blood type.
* **Donor Management:** Functionality to add new donors, record their details, and track donation history.
* **Request & Approval System:** Hospitals can request specific quantities of blood, which admins can then view, approve, or reject based on availability.
* **Dynamic Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface built with React that allows for easy navigation and clear data visualization.
* **Robust Database:** Powered by SQL to ensure data integrity, with a well-structured schema for managing complex relationships between donors, inventory, and requests.
